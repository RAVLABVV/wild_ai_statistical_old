# Numerical_Forecasts.ipynb — README

This notebook assembles **multiple time‑series forecasting approaches** (ARIMA via `pmdarima`, Random Forest, XGBoost, and a TensorFlow‑based Transformer/LSTM block) and compares them under a **unified validation workflow**. It supports **per‑class forecasting** and **hybrid/ensemble** combinations, then exports tabular results.

## What it does

- Loads a historical dataset (by default from `datasets/historical.csv`).
- Trains several model families:
  - **ARIMA/SARIMA** using `pmdarima`.
  - **Tree‑based** regressors: `RandomForestRegressor` (scikit‑learn) and `XGBRegressor` (XGBoost).
  - **Neural** models built with **TensorFlow/Keras** (Transformer encoder blocks and LSTM utilities detected).
- Runs **cross‑model validation** and **revalidation** utilities to benchmark performance.
- Produces comparison plots/tables and can **export CSV results** (e.g., `/ensamble/validation_forecast_ensemble.csv`).

## Inputs & Outputs

- **Input data**: ['datasets/historical.csv']
- **Exports**: ['/ensamble/validation_forecast_ensemble.csv']

> Tip: ensure directories exist before running export cells (e.g., create `/ensamble/` if it is used).

## Notable utilities detected

- `validate_arima_model`
- `validate_ensemble_model`
- `validate_transformer_model`
- `run_multi_class_hybrid_analysis`
- `create_all_forecasts_comparison_4plus_methods`
- `run_universal_revalidation`
- `export_multi_class_results`

## Environment

- **Python**: 3.10–3.11 recommended
- **Hardware**: CPU‑only is fine for classical models; GPU is optional for TensorFlow if you plan to train larger neural models.
- **OS**: Linux/Mac/Windows

## Quickstart

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (example with `venv`):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Put your input CSV at the path expected by the notebook (default: `datasets/historical.csv`) or edit the path in the relevant cell.

4. Launch Jupyter and run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook /mnt/data/Numerical_Forecasts.ipynb
   ```

## Customization

- Replace the input path(s) for your own data.
- Toggle models/sections as needed—each family (ARIMA, tree‑based, neural) can be run independently.
- Extend the **ensemble** by blending predictions from the per‑model outputs.
- Use the validation helpers to add metrics (e.g., MSE, MAE, MAPE) or custom class‑wise scoring.

## Reproducibility

- For deterministic behavior in classical models, set seeds (NumPy, scikit‑learn).
- TensorFlow/torch determinism may require additional flags and can still vary across runs/hardware.
